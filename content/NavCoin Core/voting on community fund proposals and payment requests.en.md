Inside the NavCoin Core wallet, in the toolbar under `Community Fund` you can either click `Vote for Proposals` or `Vote for Payment Requests`.

This will open up a window that will allow you to vote yes, no or remove your vote from Proposals and Payment Requests. There is also a button to open the item up on www.navexplorer.com to see more details about it.

See the animation below for an example.
