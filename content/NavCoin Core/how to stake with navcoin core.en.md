Your wallet must be open and 'unlocked for staking' in order to begin staking. This means your computer must be turned on and the wallet must be open.


### How to unlock for staking

In the wallet software, in the toolbar, click `Settings` and then `Unlock wallet for staking`. You will be prompted to enter your wallet password, enter your password and click 'OK'.

Your wallet is now unlocked for staking.

The image below shows the wallet is unlocked for staking.

It may take several seconds for your wallet to actually begin staking, and the amount of time it will take for your wallet to find a successful stake will depend on how many coins you are staking and other factors.

Your coins will not be able to stake if they are 'immature'. For more information on this and things related to staking see [this article](https://medium.com/@bocyaj2012/nav-coin-proof-of-stake-informational-guide-71c9c3417212)
