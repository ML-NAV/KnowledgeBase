## Note

The NavCoin data folder contains important files including the blockchain, the `wallet.dat` and the `navcoin.conf`. Messing with these files without knowing what you are doing can lead to the loss of coins so proceed with caution!

Make sure you have a back up your wallet before making changes to this directory.
For information on backing up your wallet see [this guide](/navcoin-core/backup-your-wallet)
