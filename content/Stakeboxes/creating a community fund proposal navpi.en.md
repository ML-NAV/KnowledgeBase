Open the webview of your NavPi in your web browser  
e.g. 192.168.30.247

In the top navigation menu click 'Community Fund'

On the community fund page you will see the Create Proposal form. Fill it in and click the GENERATE COMMAND button

Copy the command that it generates and paste it into the `Command` text input below.

Click the Issue Command button.

Your proposal has now been submitted


### If something went wrong

If something went wrong make sure that:  

You have at least 50 NAV in your wallet as this is the minimum fee required to submit a proposal

You pasted in the entire `createproposal` command

Your wallet didn’t relock itself before you pasted in the `createproposal` command (if you’re using the NavCoin Core Wallet)
